After all the battles,*
 *
 *
Japan was completely knocked down by the Battle Cats.*
 *
 *
A government of the Cats,*
 *
 *
by the Cats,for the Cats is about to begin now.*
 *
 *
That’s what I thought..*
 *
 *
After all,*
 *
 *
our life did not change at all.*
 *
 *
If I have to say something,*
 *
 *
I see more cats than before.*
 *
 *
That's it.*
 *
 *
By the way,*
 *
 *
I saw that the cats*
 *
 *
came to my office for a job interview.*
 *
 *
No matter how busy we are,*
 *
 *
a cat is just cat.*
 *
 *
Couldn’t get the job.*
 *
 *
I feel lucky*
 *
 *
if I see Cats in school or in the office.*
 *
 *
Don’t you?*
 *
 *
Anyways,*
 *
 *
Congratulations to the Battle Cats!*
 *
 *
Thank you Battle Cats!*
 *
 *
Battle Cats are forever!*
