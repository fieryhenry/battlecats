*
In %d, the USA launched a secret project.*
*
To wake up Japanese people from being too peaceful,*
their new weapon was sent into Japan.Code name “Battle Cats”*
*
*
Japanese people are too kind and nice to*
use cruel weapons against the Battle Cats.*
*
*
Only because  of cuteness..*
*
*
Yes, Japanese leading-edge *
weapons are useless against Battle Cats.*
*
*
By the way, *
I saw that the developer of the Battle Cats was interviewed on TV.*
*
*
The interviewer asked,*
*
“Why is the new weapon is a Cat?”*
*
He answered,*

“I love pussy cats”.*
*
I know...it's insane.*
*
*
My terrible hand writing made me stop writing this letter.*
*
*
I have forgotten how bad my writing was.*
*
My biggest mistake was that*
*
*
I wasn’t sure who to write to.*
*
*
When I look back on time, *
*
*
I used to have a dream  becoming a major leaguer.*
*
Becoming a millionaire by *
running a SNS business is*
the dream I have now.*
*
*
Can’t buy me love?*
*
*
YES or NO*
*
*
*
In either case,*
*
*
I want to tell you one thing.*
*
*
“Battle Cats” are not really bad.*
*
*
*
......That’s all I want to say at the moment.*
